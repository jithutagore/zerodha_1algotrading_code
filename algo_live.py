Building a live algo trading strategy with Zerodha requires a more complex setup, 
but the basic process is as follows:

Connect to Zerodha's API using the KiteConnect library.
Set up a streaming data connection to receive real-time market data updates.
Implement your trading strategy based on the market data updates.
Use the place_order method of the KiteConnect object to execute orders based on your 
trading strategy.
Here is a sample code that demonstrates this process:
"""
import logging
from kiteconnect import KiteConnect
from kiteconnect import KiteTicker

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

api_key = "your_api_key"
api_secret = "your_api_secret"
access_token = "your_access_token"
kite = KiteConnect(api_key=api_key)

# Set access token
kite.set_access_token(access_token)

# Set up streaming data connection
tickers = ['RELIANCE', 'INFY']  # List of symbols to subscribe
kws = KiteTicker(api_key, access_token)
last_price = {}

def on_ticks(ws, ticks):
    for tick in ticks:
        last_price[tick['instrument_token']] = tick['last_price']
        print(tick)

def on_connect(ws, response):
    ws.subscribe(tickers)
    ws.set_mode(ws.MODE_FULL, tickers)

kws.on_ticks = on_ticks
kws.on_connect = on_connect
kws.connect()

# Implement trading strategy
def execute_strategy():
    for symbol, price in last_price.items():
        # Implement your trading strategy here
        if symbol == kite.quote("NSE", "RELIANCE")["instrument_token"]:
            if price > 2000:
                # Place order
                order_id = kite.place_order(variety="regular",
                                             exchange="NSE",
                                             tradingsymbol="RELIANCE",
                                             transaction_type="BUY",
                                             quantity=100,
                                             order_type="MARKET",
                                             product="CNC",
                                             validity="DAY")
                print("Order placed. ID is:", order_id)

# Run trading strategy
while True:
    execute_strategy()

"""
In this example, we first set up a KiteConnect object and 
connect to Zerodha's API using our API key and access token. We then set up a 
streaming data connection using the KiteTicker library, which allows us to receive 
real-time market data updates for a list of symbols.

We define a callback function on_ticks that receives market data updates and 
stores the latest price for each symbol in a dictionary last_price. We also define a
 callback function on_connect that subscribes to the list of symbols and sets the 
 streaming mode to MODE_FULL.

We then implement our trading strategy in the execute_strategy function, which is
 called in a loop. In this example, we simply check if the price of Reliance Industries 
 is above 2000 and place a buy order for 100 shares if it is.

Note that this is just a simple example to illustrate the basic process of implementing
 a live algo trading strategy with Zerodha. To build a more complex strategy, you will 
 need to combine this code with other Python libraries and code to analyze market data,
  make trading decisions, and execute orders.
